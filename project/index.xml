      <description>Kyle Juetten, kjj865 Introduction
In this data analysis project I am interested in examining if there are any trends as to who survived the incident with the Titanic. The 5 variables in this data set are the name of the passenger, whether they survived or not (binary), the sex of the passenger, the age (numeric), and what class they were in (numeric). There are 1309 observations in total. I anticipate some sort of trend for those who survived pertaining to either the age of the passengers, the passenger class, or both.</description>
